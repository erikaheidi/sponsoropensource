## Who am I?
I am a backend engineer that loves to architect systems, create new DevTools, and automate processes. I am currently working at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com).

Topics that I am especially interested in: 
- DevTools;
- Automation;
- Software architecture;
- APIs;
- Events architecture.

I like to speak and share knowledge. I speak mostly in tech conferences and as a guest on YouTube channels. [Here](https://www.cmaiacd.com/appearances/) you can find my last appearances.

I've also helped to organize some tech events like:

- [Pyjamas](https://pyjamas.live) 2019/2020 (co-creator and organizer)
- [EuroPython 2020](https://ep2020.europython.eu)
- [Python Brasil 2020](https://2020.pythonbrasil.org.br)

I am an open-source advocate that believes in the power of tech communities.

## ScanAPI

Currently, my main project is the [ScanAPI](https://scanapi.dev). **ScanAPI** is a testing framework that provides automated integration testing and live documentation for any REST API.  

Given an API specification, written in YAML/JSON format, the library hits the specified endpoints, runs the test cases, and generates a detailed report of this execution - that can be also used as the API documentation itself. 

With few lines, the user can define endpoints to be hit, and the expected behaviors for each response, and, as a result, receives a full real-time diagnostic of the API.

I strongly believe in the potential of **ScanAPI** mainly because:
- It works for **any** REST API, it doesn't matter how it was built;
- It is extremely useful for testing and documenting both **owned** and **third-party** APIs;
- It is possible to chain requests, which is essential for testing complex scenarios;
- The documentation is automatically generated, it never gets outdated;
- It is simple. The syntax is simple, and it requires almost no language-specific knowledge;
- It is extremely flexible, once pure python code is accepted in the specification;

## Sponsorship

By funding my work, you'll be funding the maintenance and development of the whole ScanAPI ecosystem. The library and all related repositories, like the website, the GitHub action, the vscode-plugin, the examples repo... you can check all of them in the [ScanAPI Org](https://github.com/scanapi)

Besides, you'll be funding also my knowledge sharing. To create more content, give more talks, and help at conferences. And also, of course, helping in other open-source projects written in Python/Ruby that might need help.
